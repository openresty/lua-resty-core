http subsystem

```nginx
http {
    upstream backend {
        server 0.0.0.1;   # just an invalid address as a place holder

        balancer_by_lua_block {

            -- well, usually we calculate the peer's host and port
            -- according to some balancing policies instead of using
            -- hard-coded values like below
            local host = "127.0.0.2"
            local port = 8080

            local ok, err = balancer.set_current_peer(host, port)

    }

    server {
        # this server is just for mocking up a backend peer here...

        location = /fake {
            echo "this is the fake backend peer...";
        }

Description
===========

This Lua module provides API functions to allow defining highly dynamic NGINX load balancers for
any existing nginx upstream modules like [ngx_http_proxy_module](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html),
[ngx_http_fastcgi_module](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_fastcgi_module.html) and
[ngx_stream_proxy_module](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_proxy_module.html).

It allows you to dynamically select a backend peer to connect to (or retry) on a per-request
basis from a list of backend peers which may also be dynamic.

Methods
=======

All the methods of this module are static (or module-level). That is, you do not need an object (or instance)
to call these methods.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

set_current_peer
----------------
**syntax:** *ok, err = balancer.set_current_peer(host, port)*

**context:** *balancer_by_lua&#42;*

Sets the peer address (host and port) for the current backend query (which may be a retry).

Domain names in `host` do not make sense. You need to use OpenResty libraries like
[lua-resty-dns](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-dns) to obtain IP address(es) from
all the domain names before entering the `balancer_by_lua*` handler (for example,
you can perform DNS lookups in an earlier phase like [access_by_lua*](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#access_by_lua)
and pass the results to the `balancer_by_lua*` handler via [ngx.ctx](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ngxctx).

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

set_more_tries
--------------
**syntax:** *ok, err = balancer.set_more_tries(count)*

**context:** *balancer_by_lua&#42;*

Sets the tries performed when the current attempt (which may be a retry) fails (as determined
by directives like [proxy_next_upstream](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_next_upstream), depending on what
particular nginx uptream module you are currently using). Note that the current attempt is *excluded* in the `count` number set here.

Please note that, the total number of tries in a single downstream request cannot exceed the
hard limit configured by directives like [proxy_next_upstream_tries](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_next_upstream_tries),
depending on what concrete nginx upstream module you are using. When exceeding this limit,
the `count` value will get reduced to meet the limit and the second return value will be
the string `"reduced tries due to limit"`, which is a warning, while the first return value
is still a `true` value.

get_last_failure
----------------
**syntax:** *state_name, status_code = balancer.get_last_failure()*

**context:** *balancer_by_lua&#42;*

Retrieves the failure details about the previous failed attempt (if any) when the `next_upstream` retrying
mechanism is in action. When there was indeed a failed previous attempt, it returned a string describing
that attempt's state name, as well as an integer describing the status code of that attempt.

Possible state names are as follows:
* `"next"`
    Failures due to bad status codes sent from the backend server. The origin's response is same though, which means the backend connection
can still be reused for future requests.
* `"failed"`
    Fatal errors while communicating to the backend server (like connection timeouts, connection resets, and etc). In this case,
the backend connection must be aborted and cannot get reused.

Possible status codes are those HTTP error status codes like `502` and `504`.

For stream module, `status_code` will always be 0 (ngx.OK) and is provided for compatibility reasons.

When the current attempt is the first attempt for the current downstream request (which means
there is no previous attempts at all), this
method always returns a single `nil` value.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

set_timeouts
------------
**syntax:** `ok, err = balancer.set_timeouts(connect_timeout, send_timeout, read_timeout)`

**context:** *balancer_by_lua&#42;*

Sets the upstream timeout (connect, send and read) in seconds for the current and any
subsequent backend requests (which might be a retry).

If you want to inherit the timeout value of the global `nginx.conf` configuration (like `proxy_connect_timeout`), then
just specify the `nil` value for the corresponding argument (like the `connect_timeout` argument).

Zero and negative timeout values are not allowed.

You can specify millisecond precision in the timeout values by using floating point numbers like 0.001 (which means 1ms).

**Note:** `send_timeout` and `read_timeout` are controlled by the same config
[`proxy_timeout`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_proxy_module.html#proxy_timeout)
for `ngx_stream_proxy_module`. To keep API compatibility, this function will use `max(send_timeout, read_timeout)`
as the value for setting `proxy_timeout`.

Returns `true` when the operation is successful; returns `nil` and a string describing the error
otherwise.

This only affects the current downstream request. It is not a global change.

For the best performance, you should use the [OpenResty](https://openresty.org/) bundle.

This function was first added in the `0.1.7` version of this library.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

recreate_request
----------------
**syntax:** `ok, err = balancer.recreate_request()`

**context:** *balancer_by_lua&#42;*

Recreates the request buffer for sending to the upstream server. This is useful, for example
if you want to change a request header field to the new upstream server on balancer retries.

Normally this does not work because the request buffer is created once during upstream module
initialization and won't be regenerated for subsequent retries. However you can use
`proxy_set_header My-Header $my_header` and set the `ngx.var.my_header` variable inside the
balancer phase. Calling `balancer.recreate_request()` after updating a header field will
cause the request buffer to be re-generated and the `My-Header` header will thus contain
the new value.

**Warning:** because the request buffer has to be recreated and such allocation occurs on the
request memory pool, the old buffer has to be thrown away and will only be freed after the request
finishes. Do not call this function too often or memory leaks may be noticeable. Even so, a call
to this function should be made **only** if you know the request buffer must be regenerated,
instead of unconditionally in each balancer retries.

This function was first added in the `0.1.20` version of this library.
